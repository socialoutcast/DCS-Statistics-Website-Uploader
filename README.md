### Troubleshooting Docker Issues

**Windows Specific Issues:**

1. **"Docker Desktop is not running"**
   - Solution: `dcs-docker-manager.bat` will attempt to start it automatically
   - Manual: Start Docker Desktop from Start Menu

2. **"Port 9080 is already in use"**
   - Solution: The scripts automatically find an available port
   - Manual: Edit `.env` file and change `WEB_PORT=9080` to another port

3. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Solution: Run `dcs-docker-manager.bat pre-flight` first
   - This fixes file permissions and line endings

4. **"WSL2 not installed"**
   - Solution: Enable WSL2 in Docker Desktop settings
   - Or run: `wsl --install` in PowerShell as Administrator

**All Platforms:**

1. **Container won't start:**
   ```bash
   # Remove old containers
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build --no-cache
   ```

2. **View container logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

3. **Reset everything:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up
   ```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Navigate to the extracted folder
cd DCS-Statistics-Dashboard

# Run pre-flight checks first (recommended for new installs)
dcs-docker-manager.bat pre-flight

# Start the containers
dcs-docker-manager.bat

# Other commands
dcs-docker-manager.bat stop      # Stop the container
dcs-docker-manager.bat restart   # Restart the container
dcs-docker-manager.bat status    # Check if running
dcs-docker-manager.bat logs      # View live logs
dcs-docker-manager.bat destroy   # Remove everything (with confirmation)
```

**Windows Command Prompt (Batch):**
```batch
REM Navigate to the extracted folder
cd DCS-Statistics-Dashboard

REM Run the launcher (double-click or run in cmd)
dcs-docker-manager.bat
```

**Linux (Bash):**
```bash
# Navigate to the extracted folder
cd DCS-Statistics-Dashboard

# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x dcs-docker-manager.sh

# Run the launcher
./dcs-docker-manager.sh

# Other commands
./dcs-docker-manager.sh stop      # Stop the container
./dcs-docker-manager.sh restart   # Restart the container  
./dcs-docker-manager.sh status    # Check if running
./dcs-docker-manager.sh logs      # View live logs
```

#### Option 2: Manual Docker Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the extracted folder
cd DCS-Statistics-Dashboard

# Build and start (always use no-cache for consistent builds)
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:9080
```

### 🗑️ Cleanup Commands

#### **Destroy Command (Preserves Data)**

```batch
# Windows
dcs-docker-manager.bat destroy     # With confirmation prompt
dcs-docker-manager.bat destroy -f  # Skip confirmation

# Linux
./dcs-docker-manager.sh destroy     # With confirmation prompt
./dcs-docker-manager.sh destroy -f  # Skip confirmation
```

The `destroy` command will:
- Stop and remove the DCS Statistics container
- Delete the Docker image
- Remove all Docker volumes
- Clean up Docker networks
- Delete your .env configuration file
- **✅ PRESERVE your data in ./dcs-stats directory**

After destroy, run `pre-flight` to start fresh with your data intact.

#### **Sanitize Command (Complete Wipe)**

```batch
# Windows
dcs-docker-manager.bat sanitize     # With confirmation prompt
dcs-docker-manager.bat sanitize -f  # Skip confirmation

# Linux
./dcs-docker-manager.sh sanitize     # With confirmation prompt
./dcs-docker-manager.sh sanitize -f  # Skip confirmation
```

The `sanitize` command will:
- Everything that `destroy` does, PLUS:
- **❌ DELETE ./dcs-stats/data directory**
- **❌ DELETE ./dcs-stats/site-config/data directory**
- **❌ DELETE ./dcs-stats/backups directory**
- **⚠️ THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE!**

Use `sanitize` when you need a complete fresh start with no data.

### 🎨 What the Launcher Scripts Do

1. **Check Docker Installation** - Verify Docker and Docker Compose are available
2. **Port Availability** - Check if port 9080 is free, find alternative if not
3. **Container Management** - Stop any existing containers before starting
4. **Build Fresh** - Always build with `--no-cache` for consistency
5. **Network Discovery** - Display all available access URLs:
   - Local: `http://localhost:PORT`
   - Network: `http://YOUR_NETWORK_IP:PORT`
   - External: `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:PORT` (requires port forwarding)
6. **Port Forwarding Guide** - Show router configuration instructions if needed

### 🛠️ Manual Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the container
docker compose down

# Update to latest version
git pull
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# Access container shell
docker compose exec dcs-stats-web bash

# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep dcs-statistics
```

### 🔧 Custom Port Configuration

The launcher scripts automatically handle port selection, but you can set a preferred port:

**Method 1: Edit `.env` file**
```bash
# Create or edit .env file
echo "WEB_PORT=8090" > .env

# Run launcher - it will use 8090 or find next available
./dcs-docker-manager.sh  # or .\dcs-docker-manager.bat on Windows
```

**Method 2: Manual Docker Compose**
```bash
# Set port and start
export WEB_PORT=8090
docker compose up -d
```

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Docker Deployment

#### Windows-Specific Issues

**"Invalid pool request" Error:**
- Fixed in this version - network configuration simplified
- Run `dcs-docker-manager.bat pre-flight` to ensure proper setup

**Line Ending Issues (CRLF vs LF):**
```powershell
# Auto-fix all line endings
dcs-docker-manager.bat pre-flight
```

**Permission/Volume Issues:**
- Container automatically detects Windows and adjusts permissions
- No manual intervention needed

**Docker Desktop Not Running:**
```powershell
# The fix script will detect and prompt to start Docker Desktop
dcs-docker-manager.bat pre-flight
```

#### Port Already in Use
The launcher scripts automatically find an available port. If running manually:
```bash
# Check what's using port 9080
# Linux
lsof -i :9080
# Windows PowerShell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9080

# Use a different port
WEB_PORT=8090 docker compose up -d
```

#### Docker Not Found
- **Windows**: Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and enable WSL2 backend
- **Linux**: Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose

#### Permission Denied (Linux)
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in, or run
newgrp docker
```

#### Container Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs

# Windows: Fix common issues first
dcs-docker-manager.bat pre-flight

# Rebuild from scratch
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

```

### 🎨 **Theme Not Applying**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check theme selection saved in admin panel
3. Verify CSS file permissions
4. Check browser console for errors

### 🔄 **Update Failures**
1. Check file permissions on web server
2. Ensure backup directory is writable
3. ```extension=zip``` Enabled in your ```php.ini``` example of a disabled extention is ```;extension=zip```
4. Verify GitHub connectivity
5. Check PHP error logs
6. Manual update via Docker: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
