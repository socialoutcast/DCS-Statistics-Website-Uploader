#### Dynamic Responsive Layout System
**What Changed:** Implemented adaptive width system that responds to any screen size
**Why:** Fixed width layouts don't work well on modern devices with varied screen sizes.

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- **Extra Large (1400px+)**: 80% width, maximum feature set
- **Large (1200px-1399px)**: 90% width, full functionality  
- **Medium (769px-1199px)**: 92% width, optimized layout
- **Small (481px-768px)**: 95% width, stacked elements
- **Mobile (≤480px)**: 98% width, minimal padding

### 🔍 **Bulletproof Search System**

#### Multi-Layered Search Architecture
**What Changed:** Completely rebuilt search to be bulletproof with multiple fallback mechanisms
**Why:** Users complained search was "crap and does not always work" - needed comprehensive reliability.

**Search Flow:**
1. **Direct API Lookup**: Instant exact name matching via `/getuser` endpoint
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles typos and partial names intelligently  
3. **Multi-Endpoint Fallback**: Falls back to `/topkills` and `/topkdr` for comprehensive coverage
4. **Smart Results**: Multiple matches display user-friendly selection interface

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful API failures with JSON fallback system
- User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
- Debug logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
- Consistent experience across all search pages

#### Exact Nickname Matching
**What Changed:** Fixed "No pilot found" errors by using exact nicknames from API responses
**Why:** Search would find users but stats lookup would fail due to nickname mismatches.

**Technical Solution:**
- Use exact `nick` field from `/getuser` API response for `/stats` calls
- Preserve original search input while using API-provided exact names
- Added comprehensive debug logging to trace API call flow
- Eliminated null element errors with safe DOM updates

### 🎛️ **Smart Feature Management**

#### Granular Feature Control System
**What Changed:** Implemented comprehensive feature toggle system with dynamic content hiding
**Why:** Different communities need different features - one size doesn't fit all.

**Feature Categories:**
```php
// Combat Statistics
'pilot_combat_stats' => true,     // Kills, deaths, K/D ratio
'pilot_flight_stats' => true,     // Takeoffs, landings, crashes  
'pilot_session_stats' => true,    // Last session data
'pilot_aircraft_chart' => true,   // Aircraft usage charts

// Credits System
'credits_enabled' => true,        // Enable credits system
'credits_leaderboard' => true,    // Credits rankings

// Squadron Features (disabled by default)
'squadrons_enabled' => false,     // Squadron system
'squadron_management' => false,   // Squadron admin tools
'squadron_statistics' => false,   // Squadron stats
```

#### Dynamic Content Rendering
**What Changed:** Statistics tiles and charts only display when features are enabled
**Why:** Showing disabled features or N/A values creates poor user experience and confusion.

**Implementation:**
- PHP feature checks prevent disabled content from rendering
- JavaScript dynamically populates only enabled statistics
- Safe element updates prevent null reference errors
- Clean interfaces with no empty or disabled sections

### 📊 **Enhanced Data Architecture**

#### API-First Implementation
**What Changed:** Enforced API usage across all sites, removed JSON-only fallback mode
**Why:** API provides real-time data while JSON files can become stale between uploads.

**System Changes:**
- Set `use_api: true` and `fallback_to_json: false` by default
- All search and statistics use live API data
- Maintained JSON support for squadron features (not available via API)
- Smart routing chooses optimal data source per request type

#### Squadron Features Disabled by Default  
**What Changed:** Squadron features are now disabled by default in `site_features.php`
**Why:** Many DCS servers don't use squadrons - showing empty squadron pages confuses users.

**Default Configuration:**
```php
'squadrons_enabled' => false,
'squadron_management' => false, 
'squadron_statistics' => false,
```

### 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

#### Simplified Leaderboard
**What Changed:** Removed search and pagination from leaderboard, showing only top 10
**Why:** Leaderboards should highlight the best performers - search belongs on dedicated pages.

**Improvements:**
- Clean top 10 display with trophy system
- No search confusion or pagination complexity
- Focus on recognizing top performers
- Consistent with sports leaderboard conventions

#### Unified Pilot Cards
**What Changed:** Standardized pilot credits and statistics pages to use identical card design
**Why:** Users complained about inconsistent box styles between pages.

**Unified Features:**
- Same dark theme with green accent colors
- Identical padding, margins, and spacing
- Consistent typography and layout structure
- Responsive behavior across all screen sizes

#### Search Bar Consistency
**What Changed:** All search bars now follow unified alignment and styling patterns
**Why:** Different search bar styles on each page created inconsistent user experience.

**Standardized Elements:**
- Perfect centering with 20px right offset for visual balance
- Consistent button styling with gradient effects
- Unified input field styling with focus states
- Responsive behavior that stacks on mobile devices

### 🔒 **Enhanced Security Features**

#### Dynamic Content Security Policy
**What Changed:** CSP headers now dynamically include API endpoints based on configuration
**Why:** Static CSP headers would block legitimate API calls when users change configurations.

**Implementation:**
```php
// Automatically configures CSP based on API settings
header("Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
       connect-src 'self' {$dynamicApiUrl}; 
       script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net;");
```

#### Safe Element Updates
**What Changed:** Added comprehensive null element protection throughout JavaScript
**Why:** Users reported "Cannot set properties of null" errors when DOM elements didn't exist.

**Safety Measures:**
- Helper functions to safely update element text content
- Existence checks before all DOM manipulations
- Graceful handling of missing page elements
- Console warnings for debugging missing elements

### 📱 **Responsive Design Excellence**

#### Mobile-First Approach
**What Changed:** Redesigned all layouts to work perfectly on mobile devices first
**Why:** Increasing mobile usage requires mobile-optimized experiences.

**Mobile Optimizations:**
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Readable text sizes without zooming

## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-28

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

#### Server Statistics Data Calculation
**What Changed:** Fixed server statistics to use correct event types from actual data structure
**Why:** The dashboard was showing incorrect statistics due to mismatched event types and incorrect data field references.

**Technical Fixes:**
- Changed visit counting from S_EVENT_MISSION_START to S_EVENT_TAKEOFF (actual server activity)
- Updated kill counting to use S_EVENT_HIT events instead of S_EVENT_KILL
- Enhanced death tracking to include all death-related events:
  - S_EVENT_CRASH
  - S_EVENT_EJECTION
  - S_EVENT_PILOT_DEAD
  - S_EVENT_KILL (when target is an airplane)
- Removed artificial fallback logic that was inflating visit counts

#### Chart Alignment Fixes
**What Changed:** Fixed left-aligned charts on dashboard and pilot statistics pages
**Why:** Charts and content were aligned to the left side of the page instead of being properly centered, affecting the visual presentation.

**Technical Fixes:**
- Added proper centering to main element on both pages
- Set max-width: 1400px for index.php to accommodate wider dashboard layout
- Set max-width: 1200px for pilot_statistics.php for optimal readability
- Maintains responsive design with proper centering on all screen sizes

#### Carrier Trap Tracking Fixes
**What Changed:** Fixed carrier trap statistics showing 0 for pilots with actual traps
**Why:** The system was looking for incorrect field names in traps.json, causing all trap counts to show as zero even for pilots with multiple carrier landings.

**Technical Fixes:**
- Corrected UCID field lookup to use `player_ucid` from actual data format
- Implemented proper Navy grading system mapping:
  - OK = 4.0 (Perfect pass)
  - Fair = 3.0-3.9
  - No Grade = 2.0-2.9
  - C (Cut) = 1.0-1.9 (Dangerous approach)
  - WO (Wave Off) = 0-0.9
- Added wire-based score adjustments (3-wire is perfect, others get deductions)
- Inverted points field logic (0 = good trap, 1 = wave off)

#### Carrier Landing Performance Chart
**What Changed:** Added new performance distribution chart for carrier landings
**Why:** Pilots need to track their carrier landing proficiency over time. Visual representation helps identify areas for improvement.

**Features Added:**
- Bar chart showing distribution of landing grades
- Color-coded grades matching Navy standards (green to red)
- Percentage breakdown in tooltips
- Average trap score display
- Only shows for pilots with carrier operations

#### Dashboard Data Display Fixes
**What Changed:** Fixed empty charts for top pilots and squadrons on main dashboard
**Why:** Charts were showing blank when no "S_EVENT_MISSION_START" events existed, making the dashboard appear broken.

**Improvements:**
- Fallback to count any player activity as a visit when no mission starts exist
- Show "No mission data available yet" message instead of empty charts
- Graceful handling of empty squadron data
- Proper null/zero value handling in all calculations

#### Layout & Centering Improvements
**What Changed:** Centered all graphs and improved responsive layouts
**Why:** Charts were left-aligned and looked unbalanced on larger screens. Mobile layouts were breaking on some devices.

**Visual Improvements:**
- Centered graph containers with max-width constraints
- Index dashboard: 1200px max-width, 2-column grid
- Pilot statistics: 1000px max-width, 2-column grid
- Improved mobile breakpoints (collapses to 1 column below 768px)
- Better spacing and padding for visual hierarchy

#### Search Result Filtering
**What Changed:** Filter out players with no statistics from search results
**Why:** Search was returning all players in the database, including those who never flew, cluttering results with irrelevant entries.

**Implementation:**
- Only returns players with mission events or trap data
- Checks both missionstats.json and traps.json for activity
- Updated message: "No pilots with recorded statistics found"
- Significantly cleaner and more relevant search results

### 🎯 Server Dashboard Transformation

#### Interactive Statistics Dashboard

- Responsive grid layout (2 columns desktop, 1 mobile)
- Enhanced tooltips with formatted numbers
- Axis titles for clarity on all charts

### 🛬 Carrier Operations Tracking

#### Carrier Trap Statistics
**What Changed:** Added carrier trap tracking to pilot statistics
**Why:** Naval aviators need recognition for successful carrier landings (traps). This metric is crucial for pilots flying carrier-based aircraft and adds depth to flight statistics.

**Implementation:**
- Reads trap data from `traps.json` file
- Displays "Carrier Traps" statistic between Landings and Crashes
- Enhanced Flight Statistics chart:
  - Dynamically shows separate slices for land vs carrier landings
  - Land landings (green), Carrier traps (blue)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-28

### 🔒 Security Enhancements

#### Environment Variable Configuration System
**What Changed:** Added support for `.env` files and environment variables for configuration
**Why:** Storing credentials in config files is a security risk. Environment variables keep sensitive data out of version control and allow different configurations per environment without code changes.

#### Secure FTP (FTPS) Implementation
**What Changed:** Upgraded FTP connections to use FTPS with TLS encryption by default
**Why:** Plain FTP transmits credentials and data in cleartext. FTPS encrypts all communication, protecting against credential theft and data interception on networks.

#### API Rate Limiting System
**What Changed:** Implemented session-based rate limiting for all API endpoints
**Why:** Without rate limiting, APIs are vulnerable to abuse and DoS attacks. Rate limiting prevents automated attacks and ensures fair resource usage across users.

#### XSS Protection Layer
**What Changed:** Added comprehensive input sanitization and output encoding across all user inputs
**Why:** User inputs displayed without sanitization can execute malicious JavaScript, stealing user data or performing unauthorized actions. XSS protection prevents these attacks.

#### HTTP Security Headers
**What Changed:** Added Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options headers
**Why:** Modern browsers use security headers to prevent common attacks. CSP prevents XSS, X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking, and X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME confusion attacks.

#### Direct File Access Protection
**What Changed:** Added `.htaccess` rules to block direct access to JSON data files
**Why:** Direct file access could expose sensitive player data or allow unauthorized data harvesting. Access protection ensures data is only available through controlled API endpoints.

#### Input Validation Framework
**What Changed:** Implemented comprehensive input validation with character whitelisting
**Why:** Unvalidated inputs can contain malicious data or cause application errors. Validation ensures only expected data formats are processed, preventing injection attacks.

#### JSON Data Validation
**What Changed:** Added validation for NDJSON file structure and content before processing
**Why:** Malformed JSON can cause application crashes or security vulnerabilities. Validation ensures data integrity and prevents processing of corrupted or malicious data.

#### Secure Logging System
**What Changed:** Implemented structured logging with automatic rotation and sanitization
**Why:** Logs can contain sensitive information and grow infinitely. Secure logging prevents information leakage while maintaining operational visibility with manageable file sizes.

#### Path Traversal Protection
**What Changed:** Added path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
**Why:** Unchecked file paths can allow attackers to access files outside intended directories. Path validation prevents unauthorized file system access.

### 🎨 User Interface Improvements

#### Trophy Box Centering Fix
**What Changed:** Fixed centering of trophy boxes on pilot credits page using flexbox wrapper
**Why:** Poor visual alignment creates unprofessional appearance and bad user experience. Proper centering improves visual hierarchy and makes the interface more polished.

#### Leaderboard Trophy Integration
**What Changed:** Added top 3 trophy display to leaderboard page matching the credits page design
**Why:** Inconsistent UI elements across pages create confusion and poor user experience. Unified trophy displays provide consistent recognition of top performers.

#### CSS Code Cleanup
**What Changed:** Removed duplicate CSS rules and consolidated styling definitions
**Why:** Duplicate CSS causes maintenance issues, larger file sizes, and potential styling conflicts. Clean CSS improves performance and maintainability.

#### Comprehensive Pilot Statistics Page
**What Changed:** Built complete pilot search functionality from scratch with dynamic data fetching
**Why:** Users need detailed individual player statistics for community management and engagement. The search page provides comprehensive player profiles with all relevant data in one place.

### 📚 Documentation Improvements

#### Professional README Overhaul
**What Changed:** Completely rewrote README from basic HTML list to comprehensive markdown documentation
**Why:** Poor documentation creates barriers to adoption and increases support burden. Professional documentation helps users understand, install, and maintain the system effectively.

**Why:** Users need to understand project organization for customization and troubleshooting. Clear structure documentation reduces confusion and support requests.

### ⚙️ Technical Infrastructure

#### Python Dependencies Management
**What Changed:** Added `requirements.txt` with python-dotenv dependency
**Why:** Manual dependency installation is error-prone and inconsistent across environments. Requirements files ensure all users have the same dependencies for reliable operation.

#### Git Configuration Improvements
**What Changed:** Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file to protect sensitive data
**Why:** Accidental commits of credentials or temporary files create security risks and repository pollution. Proper gitignore prevents sensitive data exposure.

#### Backward Compatibility Maintenance
**What Changed:** Ensured all security and feature updates work with existing configurations
**Why:** Breaking changes force users to reconfigure systems and can prevent updates. Backward compatibility allows seamless upgrades while improving security.

### 🔧 Development Workflow

#### SSH Key Management
**What Changed:** Added SSH agent configuration to `.bashrc` for automatic key loading
**Why:** Manual SSH key loading is tedious and error-prone. Automatic loading improves developer experience and reduces authentication failures.

#### Git History Sanitization
**What Changed:** Rewrote entire Git history to use consistent author identity and remove AI references
**Why:** Inconsistent commit authorship creates confusion about project ownership. Clean history improves professionalism and project credibility.

### 📊 Feature Enhancements

#### Dynamic Data Fetching
**What Changed:** Implemented real-time data fetching for pilot statistics with error handling
**Why:** Static data becomes stale and users expect real-time information. Dynamic fetching ensures users always see current statistics with graceful error handling.

#### Responsive Design Improvements
**What Changed:** Enhanced mobile compatibility and responsive layouts across all pages
**Why:** Users access websites from various devices. Responsive design ensures good user experience regardless of screen size or device type.
